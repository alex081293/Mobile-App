  	<h1>AutoPT</h1>
  	<h2> Autonomous Physical Therapy - A solution for Doctors to monitor and provide feedback for their patients data 24/7 </h2>


	<h2>Why AutoPT?</h2>
	Physical Therapy is an overlooked part of injuries and as such there are currently no applications for physical therapists to monitor their patients. Physical Therapy is also very easy to forget or ignore doing, which can prolong or even worsen an injury, wasting time and money. Our application is aimed at solving both of these problems. Our solution, AutoPT, will allow the Physical Therapist to increase the volume of patients he or she can see, and allow the patient to get instantaneous feedback about his or her progress.

	<h2>What is AutoPT?</h2>
	AutoPT is both a web and mobile application interface. The web aspect supports the Doctor’s needs, and the mobile application supports the patients. The web interface allows to Doctors to log into their profile, which is where they can view patients, create patients, and prescribe and create workouts. The mobile application is then used by the patient after they receive their prescriptions. They type in their unique prescription ID, view their sessions, and simply put on the device and do their sessions.  

	<h2>For the Doctor</h2>

	AutoPT allows the Dr to create patients through its web interface. The Doctor would assess their patients at the office, and prescribe it rehabilitation therapy sessions. The patient would then complete the sessions at home, and the Doctor would be able to view the patient’s workouts habits and their findings, and give feedback to the patient without them having to come into the office.			 

	<h2>For the Patients</h2>
	Patients are able to view their workouts through their phone. Once they begin their sessions, they put on the BioHarness which reads their vital signs. This data is then stored, and sent back to their Doctor. They’re able to send messages to their Doctor, report pain, and see what feedback the Doctor has given them. The application will even send notifications to you, reminding you to complete your sessions.
